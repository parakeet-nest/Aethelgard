# Requirements

## Question

How can we make the LLM capable of "making decisions" or "suggesting alternatives" based on user queries?

## Objective

I'm going to move through a dungeon (a simple 5x5 square). How can I make the LLM act as a Dungeon Master?

How can I use the LLM to determine if I can move from room to room?

## Solution: Function Calling
