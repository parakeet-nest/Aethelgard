# The Dungeon üè∞

I have a dungeon with 25 unique rooms in a 5*5 square map
Each room is a part of a larger square grid, with 5 rows and 5 columns:
Here's an ASCII representation of the dungeon with 5 rows and 5 columns, where each square is numbered room:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+
|  1|  2|  3|  4|  5|
+---+---+---+---+---+
|  6|  7|  8|  9| 10|
+---+---+---+---+---+
| 11| 12| 13| 14| 15|
+---+---+---+---+---+
| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20|
+---+---+---+---+---+
| 21| 22| 23| 24| 25|
+---+---+---+---+---+
```

Each room is labeled with its corresponding number, starting from 1 in the top-left corner and ending with 25 in the bottom-right corner.

Here is a list of possible connections between the rooms in the 5x5 grid, where each room can be connected to its adjacent rooms (up, down, left, right, and diagonally):

### Room Connections

This setup ensures that each room is connected to its immediate neighbors, allowing for movement throughout the entire grid.
