only generate the room description

how to handle the objects carried by the player
how to remoce an object from the player's inventory
how to remoce an object from a room

so a unique prompt for all the dungeon is too much and the results are not good

or, only a prompt to generate a room description
and run the prompt n times

but how to be sure that we don't repeat the same room description?

---
First: a prompt too generate 25 room's name
-> json output

todo: give the list of the NPC and add some of them in a room
